## 🚧 Work in progress notice 📝

⚠️ **Heads Up!** This plugin is currently in beta development.  
Although fully functional, you may encounter:

- Occasional problems with text positioning on the PDF .
- Limited support for colored fonts (best results with black/dark text).
- Slight variations in overlay accuracy depending on PDF resolution.

### Optimal results when :
- 📜 Using PDFs with bright, contrasting content.
- ✍️ Text editing with standard fonts and colors.
- 💡 Working with clean, high-quality scans.

We're actively working on :  
- Full support for custom fonts 🎨    
- Smarter positioning and scaling 💡
- - Improved UX for even more user-friendly interfaces 🔍
