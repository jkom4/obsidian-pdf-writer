## 🖱️ Important Note:
In most cases, right-click and drag is used to move annotations.
For certain PDF files, left-click may also work, depending on how the PDF is rendered in Obsidian.
If you experience issues with left-click, try right-click instead, which works consistently across all PDFs.

## 🚧 Work in progress notice 📝

⚠️ **Heads Up!** This plugin is currently in beta development.  
Although fully functional, you may encounter:

- Occasional problems with text positioning on the PDF .
- Limited support for colored fonts (only a few fonts available).
- Slight variations in overlay accuracy depending on PDF resolution.

### Optimum results when :
- 📜 Using PDFs with bright, high-contrast content.

We are actively working on :
- Full support for custom fonts 🎨
